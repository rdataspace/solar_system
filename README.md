## Solar System Missions
The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
Spacecraft have successfully visited the following Solar System objects:

1. The Sun
2. Inner planets (Terrestrial planets); Mercury, Venus, Earth's moon and Mars.
3. Asteroid belt; dwarf planets and asteroids.
4. Outer planets (sometimes called Jovian planets); Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
5. Kuiper belt (ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but mainly ice); Pluto (Dwarf Planet).
6. Comets.
